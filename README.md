# Weather-App
A work in progress...This is a small weather app using the OpenWeather API
For this app I used a bootswatch template theme with added bootstrap styling. Fetch API using async and await, ES6 Classes, and persisted data to local storage. Still working on making changes to the UI, changing themes based on weather conditions and time of day
